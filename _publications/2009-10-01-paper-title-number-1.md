excerpt: 'We will demonstrate a prototype system WOSView built based on the vision of the Web of Slides (WOS), which aims to link all the lectures slides so as to facilitate navigation over all the slides. The links can be created at the slide level or at the level of phrases inside a slide, and many types of links can be created. The prototype system we built implements the most basic type of links, which link slides that have similar content and integrates lectures from four different MOOCs. WOSView also supports keyword search, which generates virtual links dynamically.  We will demonstrate how the graphical interface of the WOSView enables students to flexibly navigate into slides from different courses and explore related slides using both static and dynamic links and solicit feedback from the community about the vision of WOS.
