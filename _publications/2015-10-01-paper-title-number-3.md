<div style="text-align: justify"> Figure shows the overall assignment design for developing a Expert Search Engine application to search for CS faculty experts. The problem is decomposed into modules: (a) MP2.1, (b) MP2.2, (c) MP2.3, (d) MP2.4, (e) Project. In this way, students collectively build the search engine and also learn all the major stages of developing data science applications, namely, Data Collection, Analysis and Visualization/Application Development, in a hands-on fashion. Arrows in the figure mean data or algorithms developed in preceding modules are utilized. <br><br>
