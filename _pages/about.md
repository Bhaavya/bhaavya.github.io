I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/) (UIUC) where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Dr. ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/). Previously, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's (with thesis) also at UIUC.

I'm broadly interested in applications of natural language processing and text mining, particularly for improving education. My current focus has been on generating and identifying textual analogies for various applications, such as explaining educational concepts. In our recent work, we showed how large language models could be leveraged, by using appropriately designed prompts and scoring functions, to both retrieve existing analogies from the web and discover new ones (refer to our [INLG'22](https://bhaavya.github.io/files/inlg22.pdf) and [WWW'23](https://bhaavya.github.io/files/www23.pdf) publications). 


Starting Oct 2024, I'll be joining IBM Yorktown Heights as an AI Research Scientist for IT Operations, mentored by [Dr. Yu Deng](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-dengy).
