I'm a second year Master's student at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/) advised by [Dr. ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/). I'm  primarily interested in the applications of Text Mining, Natural Language Processing, and Human-Computer Interaction especially for building intelligent education platforms. In this direction, my recent work includes augmenting lecture slides with links to other slides and expository text from textbooks. Aside from this, I'm working as a Research Assistant with [Dr. Kevin Chang](http://www.forwarddatalab.org/kevinccchang) on online Open Information Extraction, and [Dr. Karrie Karahalios](http://social.cs.uiuc.edu/people/kkarahal.html) on the [FBSApp](http://fbs.vkcsites.org/) project that aims to help families of young children with challenging behavior. <br>
Prior to joining UIUC for MS, I worked at [Gartner Inc.](https://www.gartner.com/en) as a Junior Data Scientist for two years. [Short Employee Spotlight video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx9wXUjYo5k)
