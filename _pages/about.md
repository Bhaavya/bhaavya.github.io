I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/) where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Dr. ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/). Previously, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's (with thesis) also at UIUC.

I'm broadly interested in applications of natural language processing and text mining, particularly for improving education. My current focus has been on generating and identifying textual analogies for various applications, such as explaining educational concepts. In our recent work, we showed how large language models could be leveraged to both retrieve existing analogies from the web and discover new ones using appropriately designed prompts and scoring functions (refer to our [INLG'22](https://bhaavya.github.io/files/inlg22.pdf) and [WWW'23](https://bhaavya.github.io/files/www23.pdf) publications). 


In summer 2023, I'm interning at IBM Yorktown Heights, where my mentor is [Dr. Yu Deng](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-dengy). I'm working on retrieval-augmented generation with large language models for anwering IT support questions.
