I'm a Ph.D. student at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/) advised by [Dr. ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/). I'm broadly interested in the applications of Text Mining, Natural Language Processing, and Human-Computer Interaction, especially for building intelligent platforms for education. My recent work includes augmenting lecture slides with links to other slides ([L@S 2019](http://bhaavya.github.io/files/wos_wip.pdf)), and expository text from textbooks ([L@S 2020](http://bhaavya.github.io/files/exp.pdf)). Previously, I worked at [Gartner Inc.](https://www.gartner.com/en) as a Junior Data Scientist for two years ([Short Employee Spotlight video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx9wXUjYo5k)). <br> <br>
