I'm a Ph.D. student at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/) fortunate to be advised by [Dr. ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/). I'm interested in the intersection of AI for Education and Learning, Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing. Previously, I completed my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in CS also at UIUC, and worked at [Gartner Inc.](https://www.gartner.com/en) as a Junior Data Scientist for two years ([Short Employee Spotlight video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx9wXUjYo5k)). <br> <br>
