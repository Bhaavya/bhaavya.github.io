I'm a Ph.D. student at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/) fortunate to be advised by [Dr. ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/). I'm broadly interested in human-centered machine learning using text data, such as for developing intelligent educational systems and interactive task assistants. My recent work is focused on educational text retrieval, organization, and generation. I'm experienced in various text mining and NLP techniques (e.g. pre-trained language models like T5,GPT), building systems (e.g., web-based platforms, mobile apps) based on those algorithms, and conducting user studies for need-finding and evaluation. I also love collaborating with people from multiple disciplines (e.g., health sciences) to carry out impactful research. Previously, I completed my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in CS also at UIUC, and worked at [Gartner Inc.](https://www.gartner.com/en) as a Junior Data Scientist for two years ([Short Employee Spotlight video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx9wXUjYo5k)). <br> <br>
