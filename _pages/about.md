I'm a second year Master's student at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/) advised by [Dr. ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/). I'm broadly interested in the applications of Text Mining, Natural Language Processing, and Human-Computer Interaction, especially for building intelligent platforms for education. My recent work includes augmenting lecture slides with links to other slides ([L@S 2019](http://bhaavya.github.io/files/wos_wip.pdf)), and expository text from textbooks. I'm also working as a Research Assistant with [Dr. Kevin Chang](http://www.forwarddatalab.org/kevinccchang) on user-driven, online Open Information Extraction, and with [Dr. Karrie Karahalios](http://social.cs.uiuc.edu/people/kkarahal.html) on the [FBSApp](http://fbs.vkcsites.org/) project to support families of young children with challenging behavior. Prior to joining UIUC for M.S., I worked at [Gartner Inc.](https://www.gartner.com/en) as a Junior Data Scientist for two years ([Short Employee Spotlight video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx9wXUjYo5k)) after completing my Bachelor's in Computer Science from UIUC in 2016. <br>
