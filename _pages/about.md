Hi there! I'm a second year Master's student at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) advised by [Dr. ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/). I'm primarily interested in the applications of Text Mining, Natural Language Processing, and Human-Computer Interaction for building intelligent education platforms. Prior to joining UIUC, I worked at [Gartner Inc.] as a Junior Data Scientist.
