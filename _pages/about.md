I'm an AI Research Scientist at IBM Research, NY. I'm broadly interested in applications of natural language processing and text mining, particularly for IT task automation, education and healthcare. Previously,I earned my PhD degree at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/) (UIUC) where I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/). I completed my Bachelor's and Master's (with thesis) also at UIUC.
